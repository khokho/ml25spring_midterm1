subject: quick update on loader refactor

hi julia,

just a short progress report on the loader refactor:

– integrated the new caching layer on monday  
– unit tests pass on both linux and macos runners  
– eight-hour overnight fuzzing finished with zero crashes

i plan to open the pull request tomorrow at 15:00. please let me know if that timing clashes with anything on your side.

thanks and have a great day.

alex
